# CPU-Scheduling-Simulation
ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project is a CPU Scheduling Simulator built using Streamlit, designed to visualize and analyze various CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides an interactive way to understand how different scheduling techniques work by displaying:
âœ… Scheduling results
âœ… Gantt charts
âœ… Average Waiting Time (AWT)
âœ… Average Turnaround Time (TAT)

ðŸ›  Features
ðŸ”¹ Supports the following CPU Scheduling Algorithms:

First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)

Shortest Job First (SJF) - Non-preemptive & Preemptive

Round Robin (RR)

Priority Scheduling - Non-preemptive & Preemptive

ðŸ”¹ Interactive Gantt Chart visualization
ðŸ”¹ Calculates average waiting time & turnaround time
ðŸ”¹ Simple and intuitive web-based UI built with Streamlit
